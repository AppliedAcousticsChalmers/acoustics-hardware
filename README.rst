Acoustics Hardware
==================

This Python package provides a unified interface to several hardware platforms used in acoustic measurements, e.g. audio interfaces.
The purpose of this package is twofold, both to enable cross-hardware interactions with a consistent interface, and to simplify scripting of advanced measurement setups.
